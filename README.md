# MyProjects

Project coded with the intension to facilitate divisions of bills between friends.

Life Problem that generated the idea of the application 

- People go out in large group of friends and each of them order different things and some of them share some items, so taking the whole bill 
and dividing by the quantity of friends wasn't good enough, since there would be people paying something that they did not order

- The app makes the job of dividing each item for the specific group of people that has ordered.

How the Application works for Users

- User adds friends with a name value and by default set to $0.
- User adds an Item with  a name and price assigned, and also select the "friends" that will be paying for that specific item
- At the end user has the price already divided for each friend consederign what each of them had used/bought.


How the app works for Devs

- Every time a new item is added, item is removed or a fried is removed from the list, It updates itself and calculates the whole application
again to make sure all prices maintain according to what has to be.


How the app could get better at the moment

- Needing a boost in the layout for user interface
